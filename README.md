# Autoscaling-of-Cores-and-Virtual-Memory

This repository contains the source code and data generated from the experiments related to the paper:

`Karn, Rupesh Raj, and Ibrahim Abe M. Elfadel. "Autoscaling of cores in multicore processors using power and thermal workload signatures." In 2016 IEEE 59th International Midwest Symposium on Circuits and Systems (MWSCAS), pp. 1-4. IEEE, 2016.`.

Experiments are performed in MATLAB and an Intel Xeon Bridge server containing 12 cores.

The contents in the `Memory Scaling` folder are not covered in the paper. Nevertheless, the presentation file is given in that folder to explain the source code and data.
